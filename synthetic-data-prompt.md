# Prompt for generating the data from r/DPDR

You will be given example posts and comments from an online forum where people discuss experiences with depersonalization and derealization. Please generate a new post or comment that is relatable to the examples. The generated comment should feel natural and genuine, capturing the casual, often fragmented style typical of these conversations.
Incorporate descriptions of bodily sensations or references to body parts, emphasizing feelings of disconnection or unreality, rather than purely physical or practical terms.
Use informal language, occasional sentence fragments, and expressions of existential or surreal experiences. The tone should reflect the emotional complexity and confusion common in these posts, ranging from numbness and detachment to humor and frustration.
Stay true to the lived experience of depersonalization and derealization, focusing on how users describe feeling disconnected from themselves or their surroundings.
Return only the generated text. Do not provide any further comments or explanations.
